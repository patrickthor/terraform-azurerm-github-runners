# Improvement Plan: Event-Driven Ephemeral GitHub Runners on Azure

Verified against official Microsoft documentation and Azure Well-Architected Framework (March 2026).

---

## Remaining Improvements

### Reliability

#### Deploy workflow has no retry on `terraform apply`

**Current**: The infra job in `deploy.yml` runs `terraform apply` once with no retry.

**Recommended**: Add a retry loop (like the demo workflow) to handle transient Azure WAF 403s and ARM throttling.

#### Pool `ServiceBusClient` in `_servicebus_send`

**Current**: Every webhook call creates a new `ServiceBusClient` + `DefaultAzureCredential`, opening a fresh AMQP connection.

**Recommended**: Use a module-level singleton (like `_http_session`) to pool the connection. Reduces latency and resource churn under burst webhook traffic.

#### Re-list after prune doesn't re-check for duplicate runners

**Current**: After `_prune_stale_runners` triggers a re-list, the duplicate check `_has_runner_for_workflow_job` ran against the old list. The re-listed runners aren't checked for duplicates.

**Recommended**: Move the duplicate check after the conditional re-list. Edge case but possible under heavy concurrent load.

### Security & RBAC

#### Tighten Function App RBAC scope

**Current**: Scaler Function App has `Contributor` on the entire resource group.

**Recommended**: Use a custom role with only the required ACI operations, or scope Contributor down to only the specific resources needed.

**Source**: [Azure best practices — least privilege](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/best-practices)

#### Pin GitHub Actions to commit SHAs

**Current**: ~~Actions pinned to major version tags (`@v4`, `@v2`, `@v3`).~~ **Done** — all actions pinned to commit SHAs across all workflows.

**Recommended**: ~~Pin to full commit SHA for supply chain security.~~ Add Dependabot for automatic SHA update PRs.

#### Consider GitHub Environment protection rules

**Current**: `terraform apply -auto-approve` runs automatically on push to main.

**Recommended**: For a module used by multiple consumers, consider adding a GitHub Environment with required reviewers for production applies.

#### Pin semantic-release dependencies

**Current**: `release.yml` runs `npm install -g semantic-release @semantic-release/...` without version pins.

**Recommended**: Pin exact versions or use a lockfile to prevent unexpected breaking changes. The `release.yml` job has `contents: write`, `issues: write`, and `pull-requests: write` permissions — unpinned packages execute with these privileges.

#### Document broad subscription-level roles in README

**Current**: README step 2 grants `Contributor`, `User Access Administrator`, and `Role Based Access Control Administrator` at subscription scope.

**Recommended**: Add a note about scoping these down for production, or provide a least-privilege alternative using resource group scope where possible.

#### Runner workload roles have no guardrail for overly broad grants

**Current**: `runner_workload_roles` is granted at subscription scope (`/subscriptions/{id}`). A consumer setting `["Contributor"]` gives every ephemeral runner container Contributor on the entire subscription.

**Recommended**: Add a validation rule or documentation warning against broad roles. Consider allowing scope override (e.g. resource group scope instead of subscription).

#### Key Vault network ACL defaults to Allow

**Current**: Key Vault `network_acls { default_action = "Allow" }` when `enable_public_network_access = true` (default). The Key Vault holds GitHub App private key, installation ID, and webhook secret.

**Recommended**: For production, set `default_action = "Deny"` with appropriate bypass rules, or document the tradeoff. The Function App accesses Key Vault via `@Microsoft.KeyVault` references which work through Azure backbone, so a Deny default with `bypass = "AzureServices"` would still work.

#### Function App storage account network open with shared key enabled

**Current**: `azurerm_storage_account.functions` has `network_rules { default_action = "Allow" }` and shared key access is enabled (required for FC1 deployment storage due to [Azure bug](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/29993)).

**Recommended**: Track the upstream FC1 MSI issue. Once resolved, disable shared key access and tighten network rules. Until then, this is an accepted risk.

#### Webhook secret validation is optional — no warning when disabled

**Current**: `webhook_secret_secret_name` defaults to `null`. When unset, `_verify_github_signature()` returns `True` for any request. Anyone who discovers the Function App URL + function key can inject fake webhook events.

**Recommended**: Log a warning at Function App startup when `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is not configured. Consider making it required or adding a prominent note in the README.

#### Runner image imported from third-party source without digest pinning

**Current**: `az acr import --source ghcr.io/myoung34/docker-github-actions-runner:latest` in deploy workflows. No SHA digest verification. A compromised upstream image is pulled into ACR on every deploy.

**Recommended**: Pin to a specific digest (e.g. `ghcr.io/myoung34/docker-github-actions-runner@sha256:abc...`) or build a custom runner image from a trusted base. ACR Basic SKU does not support content trust.

### Performance

#### Pool `DefaultAzureCredential` as a module-level singleton

**Current**: `_arm_token()` creates a new `DefaultAzureCredential()` on every call. Inside `_arm_request`'s retry loop, each attempt instantiates a fresh credential.

**Recommended**: Create the credential once at module level. `DefaultAzureCredential` handles its own internal token caching and refresh.

### Python / Function App

#### Eliminate duplicate `SERVICEBUS_NAMESPACE_FQDN` app setting

**Current**: Both `SERVICEBUS_NAMESPACE_FQDN` and `SERVICEBUS_CONNECTION__fullyQualifiedNamespace` contain the same value. The Python code reads `SERVICEBUS_NAMESPACE_FQDN` in `_servicebus_send()`.

**Recommended**: Change `_servicebus_send()` to read `SERVICEBUS_CONNECTION__fullyQualifiedNamespace` instead, and remove the duplicate `SERVICEBUS_NAMESPACE_FQDN` app setting.

#### Pin Python dependencies

**Current**: `requirements.txt` uses minimum version constraints (`azure-identity>=1.16.0`) without upper bounds.

**Recommended**: Pin exact versions (e.g., `azure-functions==1.21.3`) for reproducible deployments.

#### Verify `host.json` extension bundle version range

**Current**: Extension bundle version is `[4.*, 5.0.0)`.

**Recommended**: Verify this is still the recommended range for Azure Functions v4 runtime. Update if a newer bundle is available.

### Code Style

#### Bootstrap `providers.tf` inconsistency

**Current**: `bootstrap/versions.tf` has the provider block inline instead of a separate `providers.tf`.

**Recommended**: Move the provider to `bootstrap/providers.tf` for consistency with the rest of the repo.

## Completed ✅

### Architecture & Module Structure
- Package as Terraform module — resources moved to `modules/runners/`, root is a thin wrapper, `examples/demo/` for demo usage
- Simplify variable surface — 3 core variables (`workload`, `environment`, `instance`) generate all resource names via Azure CAF conventions, with override support
- Configurable resource group creation via `create_resource_group`
- Remove stale `moved` blocks — 25 migration blocks removed after state migration completed

### Security & RBAC
- Runner workload roles default changed from `["Contributor"]` to `[]` (least privilege)
- Hardcoded subscription ID removed from demo
- Generic error messages in webhook (no exception details exposed)
- Disable shared key access on consumer state storage account (`--allow-shared-key-access false`)

### Infrastructure
- Migrate to FC1 Flex Consumption — `sku_name = "FC1"`, VNet support via `subnet_id`
- Remove storage access key — managed identity with `AzureWebJobsStorage__accountName`
- Remove instrumentation key — connection string only (instrumentation key deprecated March 2025)
- Fix `storage_account_replication_type` variable — now actually used in function storage account (was declared but hardcoded to LRS)
- Align provider versions — bootstrap, demo, and module all require `>= 4.63`

### Observability
- Log Analytics Workspace — created and linked to Application Insights
- Diagnostic settings — Key Vault, Service Bus, Function App
- Resource locks — configurable via `enable_resource_locks`

### CI/CD Workflows
- Terraform validate step added to deploy workflow
- Fix demo workflow retry logic — loops now correctly exit with failure after 3 attempts
- Improve deploy workflow role parsing — use `jq` instead of `python3` for CSV→JSON conversion
- Demo workflow uses `terraform init -upgrade` to handle lock file version updates
- Demo workflow retry for transient Azure WAF blocks on ephemeral ACI IPs

### Function App / Scaler
- Module-level HTTP session pooling (`requests.Session()`)
- Add `urllib3` retry adapter to HTTP session — automatic retries for transport-level errors (connection resets, DNS failures), simplifying `_arm_request`
- GitHub API rate limit handling in `_is_job_still_queued` — checks `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header and backs off gracefully
- Remove unused app settings — `RUNNER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MIN` and `EVENT_POLL_INTERVAL_SEC` removed (never read by Python code)
- Fix at-capacity DLQ spam — sleep 100s between retries, check GitHub job status before retrying, ACI quota retry with backoff
- Update stale references — `local.settings.example.json`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, and README now use CAF naming conventions
- Fix README Key Vault secret names to match deploy workflow defaults
- Update README scaler internals documentation

- Remove private key material from logs — `_github_installation_access_token` no longer logs the first 30 chars of the private key (security hygiene)
- Remove stale `storage_account_id` from README outputs table (was removed from code in previous cleanup)
- Make cleanup timer schedule configurable — new `cleanup_timer_schedule` variable (NCRONTAB), default changed from every 1 minute to every 3 minutes to reduce ARM API calls at scale

### Module Cleanup
- Remove unused `runner_idle_timeout_minutes` and `event_poll_interval_seconds` variables — declared but never read by Python code
- Remove redundant GitHub App auth precondition — first precondition already enforces all-set
- Remove `storage_account_id` output — only relevant to bootstrap, confusing for consumers
- Fix `storage_account_name` variable description — clarify only used with `enable_resource_locks`
- Fix stale "managed identity — no access keys" comment on function storage section
- Remove dead `GITHUB_ENVIRONMENT` app setting and variable — set by Terraform but never read by Python code
- Fix demo workflow stale plan retry — re-plan before re-apply instead of reusing stale plan file
- Fix demo workflow Terraform version pin — aligned to `~> 1.9` like all other workflows
- Fix CHANGELOG.md links — updated from old repo name to `patrickthor/github-runners`
- Rewrite DEPLOYMENT.md for Flex Consumption — removed stale Consumption plan references and `func publish` method
- Add auth context comment to `backend.hcl.example` — clarify `use_azuread_auth` vs `use_oidc`
- Fix README `subscription_id` listed as required module variable — it's a provider setting, not a module input
- Add `examples/demo/README.md`
- Remove stale `GITHUB_ENVIRONMENT` from `local.settings.example.json`

## Not Implemented (Deliberate Decision)

### Container Apps Jobs as alternative to ACI

Microsoft recommends Container Apps Jobs for self-hosted runners ([official tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/tutorial-ci-cd-runners-jobs)), and it would dramatically simplify the architecture (removes Function App, Service Bus, ~500 lines of Python). However, it has a critical limitation:

> **"Container apps and jobs don't support running Docker in containers. Any steps in your workflows that use Docker commands fail when run on a self-hosted runner."**
> — [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/tutorial-ci-cd-runners-jobs)

For a module intended for multiple consumers, Docker support (`docker build`, `docker push`, Docker Compose, Testcontainers) is a common requirement. Excluding this limits the module's applicability too much.

**Decision**: Keep ACI as the sole compute platform. A Container Apps Jobs variant could be offered as an alternative, but the complexity of maintaining two separate implementations does not outweigh the benefits.

### Service Bus Basic SKU — no dead-letter queue

The module uses Service Bus Basic tier (`sku = "Basic"`), which does not support dead-letter queue (DLQ) forwarding. Messages that exhaust all 30 delivery attempts are silently discarded.

This is acceptable because:
- Permanent config errors (missing env vars, bad values) are caught and consumed silently by the `scale_worker` to avoid DLQ spam regardless of tier
- Transient failures (ARM throttling, quota exhaustion) are retried within the function invocation itself (sleep + retry loops), so messages rarely exhaust all 30 Service Bus attempts
- The at-capacity retry logic sleeps 100s between attempts, giving ~50 minutes of retry window before the message is abandoned
- All failures are logged to Application Insights, which is the primary debugging tool — not the DLQ

Upgrading to Standard tier (~$10/month) would enable DLQ inspection for post-mortem analysis, but adds cost with minimal operational benefit given the current retry and logging strategy.

**Decision**: Keep Basic tier. The retry logic and Application Insights logging provide sufficient observability. Upgrade to Standard if you need DLQ inspection for compliance or audit requirements.
